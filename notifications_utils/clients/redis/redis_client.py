        - Sends all commands to redis as a group to be executed atomically

        Method:
        (1) Add event, scored by timestamp (zadd). The score determines order in set.
        (2) Use zremrangebyscore to delete all set members with a score between
            - Earliest entry (lowest score == earliest timestamp) - represented as '-inf'
